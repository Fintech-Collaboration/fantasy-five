# Fantasy-Five

**Welcome!**

![markdown-image](pictures/zoom_01.jpg)

This repository contains the files relating to Fantasy Five, a virtual sandbox environment created for the trading of cryptocurrencies with no real risk. Users can also view various tabs containing information on the supported coins; such as OHLCV data, ML models and predictions, and Time-Series forecasts. The project was made keeping in mind that, to many, crypto is still very foreign. We wanted to create an environment that fostered curiousity by providing in-depth analysis and historical data that users could look to learn from and use to direct their practice investments.
